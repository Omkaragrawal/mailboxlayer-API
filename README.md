# mailboxlayer-API

Mailboxlayer offers a simple REST-based JSON API enabling you to thouroughly check and verify email addresses as they come into your system.

In addition to checking the syntax and the actual existence of an email address using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), the mailboxlayer API is linked to a number of regularly updated databases containing all available email providers, which simplifies the separation of disposable (e.g. "mailinator") and free email addresses (e.g. "gmail", "yahoo") from individual domains.

Combined with typo checks, did-you-mean suggestions and a numeric score reflecting the quality of each email address, these structures will make it simple to automatically filter "real" customers from abusers and increase response and success rates of your email campaigns.
